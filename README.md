⏰ Time Mentor

A personal mentor for focus, consistency, and discipline.

Time Mentor is more than a to-do list — it’s a time management system designed to keep you consistent, focused, and accountable. It combines proven productivity techniques with persuasive mentor-style nudges so you can stop procrastinating and actually execute.

🚀 Features

📝 Idea Dump – Capture tasks quickly without worrying about structure.

🎯 Focus (Big 3) – Each day, choose your top 3 most important tasks to move forward.

⛔ Blocked – Park tasks that can’t progress right now.

✅ Completed – Review and reflect on finished tasks.

🗂️ Categories – Organize tasks into areas of life/work.

🔔 Mentor Nudges – Daily notifications (morning, midday, afternoon, night) that push you to take action instead of drifting.

📊 Daily & Weekly Reports – End-of-day and end-of-week summaries on your completed tasks.

📱 Offline First – Local SQLite database, no internet needed.

✨ UI/UX – Collapsible categories, swipe gestures for edit/delete, ownership markers (Me/Other), and polished task tiles.

🧠 Underlying Method

Time Mentor draws from multiple time management techniques to keep you on track:

✍️ Ivy Lee Method – Every morning, you’re nudged to define your Big 3 tasks that matter most.

📂 Getting Things Done (GTD) – Clear your mind by dumping ideas, categorizing tasks, and blocking distractions.

⏳ Time Blocking – Notifications arrive at structured times of day (morning, midday, afternoon, night).

📅 Weekly Review – A mentor-style weekly reflection keeps you honest about progress vs. distractions.

⚡ Anti-Procrastination Prompts – Persuasive, motivational notifications designed for people who “know what to do but don’t do it.”

Together, these make Time Mentor feel less like an app and more like a mentor in your pocket.
